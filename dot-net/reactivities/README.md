# Reactivities social application!

A fairly complex web app made with dotNET and React I started in late feb, 2025  
this was also the first time I'm developing in the apple mac ecosystem (notes on that coming soon)  

## Running App
**note: this was created with a slightly custom vs code instance and might require different setup with other IDEs**

Dependences:
- Node (v22+)
- .NET (9.02+)
- I think thats it

once downloaded, just run `dotnet watch` in root directory for a localhost run.
