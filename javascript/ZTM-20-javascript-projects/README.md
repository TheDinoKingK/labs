# 20 javascript projects!

## This is a bunch of javascript projects that were learnt from a [ZTM udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/) I took in mid-2021  
For the most part they follow the code to a T, with my own customizations when I want to
  
  
Recently, I've wanted to try to host one or more of them through a docker nginx configuration, but I haven't finished that as of yet  
Thats why there's a leftover dockerfile & dockerignore in the light-dark-mode project
