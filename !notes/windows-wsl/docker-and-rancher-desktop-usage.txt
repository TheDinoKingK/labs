tried using rancher desktop on wsl for a course.

came across an issue with docker integeration, this was due to me using docker-desktop on wsl before all of this

tried a few things, deleting the .kube/config file to make it fix itself, (didn't work)
disabled kubernetes in docker-desktop, didn't seem to fix anything
