`: deploy` usually searches the type of kube.. thing?
for example, deploy, svc (services), pvc (private volume claim), pod, etc.

/ searches within logs, pods, etc. (just like vim!)



? prints shortcuts
l checks logs for pods (very helpful
d describes pods
s goes into pod shell
y prints yaml code for a pod
shift + f port forwards
shift + s sorts by status (completed, starting up, etc.)
shift + a sorts by time (newest pods get shown at the top)
