If you come from the world of java (like me)  
you know that if you want to force a variable to never change after its initialized, you just need to prefix the variable with "final", and you can't change its value after that!

like wise, typescript also has a similar thing, just not named 'final', but 'readonly', which is strikingly more obvious as to what it does, but yeah just thought this would be interesting to note
