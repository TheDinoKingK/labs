# forge mods!

## these are some old projects when I was first starting to learn how to mod with the forge ecosystem (which might have been only modding ecosystem I knew during 2021-2022)

in all honesty I don't know if I did much, they might just be minor modifications to the example mods from forge 1.16.5.
nevertheless, its history I should keep archived and y'all can look through it yourself!
