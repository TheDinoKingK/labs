# Dinos-Website Redux (Second Attempt)

This is the leftover code from my second attempt at creating a website for "thedinoking" persona after abandoning my old one to use a different framework. Started in early 2024 and promptly stopped late 2024.
I decided on using react & remix (with tallwindcss) for this project, the final commit only has a rough home link with some decent styling, the only other page that had much work other than a placeholder page was the linktree, containing a singular link button design, with some rough backend.

I probably would've kept working on this but at somepoint I messed up the entire codebase due to not understanding how to merge commit conflicts within vs code and breaking the entire project, I got quite mad about it obviously. so I decided to scrap this version and restart from scratch again.
